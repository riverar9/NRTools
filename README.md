# NRTools

This project was put together to assist with my non-rev days. While an intern at Southwest Airlines, our non-rev priority was determined by the timing of checkin. Often, I wouldn't be able to efficiently checkin to a flight due to sleeping, traveling on another leg, or being incapacitated. In order to help, I've developed this tool which would do the following:

1. Periodically read each email in a designated inbox and log all flight information from that email.
2. Check to see if any upcoming checkin times were coming up
3. Use Selenium in order to check into the flight

This tool was built a bit too late in my career at Southwest to be as useful as I hoped but was excellent for when I was able to use it.
